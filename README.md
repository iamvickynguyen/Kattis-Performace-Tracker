# Kattis Performace Tracker
Kattis Performace Tracker shows your [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/) problem solving activity. You can switch between many Kattis accounts The color for the calendar is based on github contribution graph.

I built this project to keep track of my performance solving problems on open.kattis.com. Also, I wanted to try web scraping and to practice building a web application using Flask framework, SQLite database, and Python requests module.

I spent quite a large portion of my univeristy time on solving problems on open.kattis.com with a dream of ranking #1 among former and current students and professors at UVic. My dream came true before I graduated :blush:

Check out the [UVic Scoreboard](https://open.kattis.com/universities/uvic.ca).
